Newborn Data Mining repository.

Initialy composed by the K-Medoids cluster algorithm developed for the course Information Retrieval @ Universit√† di Pisa by Antonio Ercole De Luca http://www.linkedin.com/pub/antonio-ercole-de-luca/1b/340/197.

Mainly the other standard Data Mining Repository are based on the assumption that the objects to be clustered are database records.
This Repository tries to abstract the concept of object to be clustered which is not a database record.
It needs only a Distance Function between two objects to perform the clustering task.
In other words it tries to minimize the global distance between every object and the object choosen to be the rappresentative object of the cluster (aka Medoid).




Why Should We Use Distance Matrix Instead of Instances of Attributes?
===
During the distance computation of a clustering algorithm, standard clustering libraries can spend a lot of time scanning the entire list of attributes that belongs to an instance, for example if we have a standard tf-idf rappresentation of a document, during the computation of the cosine similarity, it scans all the possibile word of the dictionary, that in many cases can be made by millions of entries.

There are many objects domains where is considerably better to use a different implementation of an object.
Another intresting domain of clustering, which the objects are not naturally suitable for an array of attributes implementation is graph clustering, which the objects to be clustered are the nodes of a graph.
